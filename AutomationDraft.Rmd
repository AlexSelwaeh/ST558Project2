Automation starts here / This is just a draft to finalize once project is finalized    
```{r}
#get unique days / might need to convert dayIDs into literal days to match the output link
dayIDs <- unique(dayData$status)

output_file <- paste0(dayIDs, ".html")


#create a list for each team with just the day parameter
params = lapply(dayIDs, FUN = function(x){list(dow = x)})


#put into a data frame 
reports <- tibble(output_file, params)
reports
```


```{r}
library(rmarkdown)
#need to use x[[1]] to get at elements since tibble doesn't simplify
apply(reports, MARGIN = 1, 
            FUN = function(x){
                render(input = "ST558Project2.Rmd", output_file = x[[1]], params = x[[2]])
                })
